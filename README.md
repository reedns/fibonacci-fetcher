First I saw on the wikipedia page that Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2).  I decided to try to implement that equation to code.  Wikipedia also said the sequence was a recurrence relation. So I figured I needed to use recursion somehow.  First I made sure that if the number equaled 1 or 0 that it should return 1.  I tried creating a loop that would count down to 8.  I looked up some information on recursion and came across this blog post: http://natashatherobot.com/recursion-factorials-fibonacci-ruby/.  While it did give me the answer it helped me better understand how recursion works in this instance.
